Texas Instruments PowerVR 3D Graphics Processing Unit

PowerVR is the family name for series of 3D Graphics Processing Units from Imagination Technologies.
Texas Instruments SoCs have integrated different generations of PowerVR 3D GPUs. For example,
PowerVR GE8430 (Series 8XE) GPU is integrated in TI DRA82x SoC.

This binding describes PowerVR 3D GPU Series integrated in Texas Instrument SoCs.

Required properties:
 - compatible : value should take the following format:
	"ti,<soc>-pvr", "img,pvr-<gpuversion>"

   accepted values:
	(a) "ti,dra822-pvr", "img,pvr-ge8430" for TI DRA82x SoC with PowerVR GE8430 GPU

 - reg: base address and length of the GPU registers
 - interrupts : GPU interrupt number
 - clocks : from SoC clock binding

Optional properties:
 - reg-names : names of registers listed in reg property in same order
 - clock-names : names of clocks listed in clocks property in the same order

Examples:

PowerVR Series8XE GE8430 GPU integrated in TI DRA82x SoC
	gpu: gpu@4e20000000  {
		compatible = "ti,dra822-pvr", "img,pvr-ge8430";
		reg = <0x4E 0x20000000 0x00 0x80000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 24 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&coreclk>, <&ctrlclk>;
		clock-names = "core", "ctrl";
	};

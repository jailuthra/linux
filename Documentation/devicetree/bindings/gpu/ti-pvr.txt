Texas Instruments PowerVR 3D Graphics Processing Unit

PowerVR is the family name for series of 3D Graphics Processing Units from Imagination Technologies.
Texas Instruments SoCs have integrated different generations of PowerVR 3D GPUs. For example,
PowerVR GE8430 (Series 8XE) GPU is integrated in TI J721E SoC.

This binding describes PowerVR 3D GPU Series integrated in Texas Instrument SoCs.

Required properties:
 - compatible : value should take the following format:
	"ti,<soc>-pvr", "img,pvr-<gpuversion>"

   accepted values:
	(a) "ti,j721e-pvr", "img,pvr-ge8430" for TI J721E SoC with PowerVR GE8430 GPU

 - reg: base address and length of the GPU registers
 - reg-names : names of registers listed in reg property in same order
 - interrupts : GPU interrupt number
 - power-domains: from SoC device description
 - clocks : from SoC clock binding
 - clock-names : names of clocks listed in clocks property in the same order

Examples:

PowerVR Series8XE GE8430 GPU integrated in TI J721E SoC
	gpu: gpu@4e20000000  {
		compatible = "ti,j721e-pvr", "img,pvr-ge8430";
		reg = <0x4e 0x20000000 0x00 0x80000>;
		reg-names = "gpu_regs";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 24 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		power-domains = <&k3_pds 124>;
		clocks = <&k3clks 123 0>;
		clock-names = "ctrl";
	};

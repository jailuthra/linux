Sensor Ancillary Metadata

Description
===========

This format describes ancillary data generated by a camera sensor and
transmitted over a stream on the camera bus. Most sensor vendors have their
own custom format for this ancillary data. Some vendors follow a generic
CSI-2/SMIA embedded data format as described in the `CSI-2 specification.
<https://mipi.org/specifications/csi-2>`_

The size of the embedded buffer is defined as a single line with a pixel width
specified in bytes and obtained by a call to the :c:type:`VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT`
ioctl on the sensor sub-device. Note that this size is fixed and cannot be
modified with a call to :c:type:`VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT`.

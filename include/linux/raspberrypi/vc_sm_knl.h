 *
 * Imports an existing dmabuf into the VideoCore shared memory subsystem,
 * making it accessible to VideoCore firmware. This allows sharing of
 * buffers allocated by other kernel drivers (such as V4L2) with VideoCore.
 *
 * The returned handle must be freed with vc_sm_cma_free() when no longer
 * needed. The handle can be passed to vc_sm_cma_int_handle() to obtain
 * the VideoCore firmware handle for use in MMAL or other VideoCore APIs.
 *
 * The imported buffer must be physically contiguous and located in memory
